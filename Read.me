Maintaining the past decades current genetic gains for tree species is a challenging task for foresters and tree breeders due to biotic and abiotic factors. Planting a mixture of genotypes or clonal composites can be an alternative to increase the phytosanitary security and yield of forest plantations. These clonal composites are more complex than monocultures due to inter-genotypic competition and indirect genetic effects that can affect the total heritable variation. This study aims to understand how indirect genetic effects can impact the response to selection and how the stand composition can be used to explore these effects and enhance forest yield. We used a clonally  trial of \emph{Eucalyptus urophylla} Ã— \emph{Eucalyptus grandis} hybrids in a randomized complete block design with 24 replications, containing a single tree per plot evaluated for mean annual increment at 3 and 6 years. We focus on partitioning the genetic variation of trees into direct and indirect genetic effects based on competition intensity factors. We identified clones as aggressive, homeostatic, and sensitive based on the magnitude of indirect genetic effects. By accounting for indirect genetic effects, for mean annual increment, the total heritability decreased 39 and 44\% for 3 and 6 years since planting, respectively.
We proposed a workflow that uses the direct and indirect genetic effect to predict the mean value of many clonal composites combinations and to select the one with highest yield. Our methodology accounted for spatial variability and interplot competition that can contribute to the total heritable variance and response to selection in forest trials. Based on the models evaluated, we extract useful information to predict different clonal composites compositions, their expected average performance, and define the best recommended combination to be planted in large scale.
